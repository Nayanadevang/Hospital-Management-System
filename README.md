🔧Technologies & Concepts Used – HMS Project
Concept / Technology Purpose in the Project
1 Python Core language used for building the HMS application.
2 Object-Oriented Programming
(OOP) - Defined Doctor, Patient, and Appointment as
3 classes with attributes and methods - Classes & Objects Encapsulated data and logic for each entity (doctor,
patient, appointment).
4 JSON Used as a lightweight file-based database to store all data persistently - File Handling Read and write JSON files to save/load doctor, patient,
and appointment data.
5 Functions Encapsulated each system operation (add, view, book) into reusable functions. - Input/Output (I/O) Took user input via console, displayed formatted outputto user.
6 Data Structures Used lists and dictionaries to hold and manage collections of data. - Conditionals (if/else) Implemented logic for menu navigation and featureselection.
Looping (while) Created the continuous running main menu using a while True loop.
7 Exception Handling (optional enhancement) -  Can be added to handle invalid input and file errors gracefully.
8 Modularity Separated logic into clearly defined blocks (e.g., model classes vs logic functions)- Cross-Platform Runs on any system with Python installed – no OSdependency
